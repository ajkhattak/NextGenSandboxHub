# Next-Generation Framework Sandbox Hub (NextGenSandboxHub)
The Next-Generation Water Resources Modeling Framework ([NextGen](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/ngen)), developed by the NOAA's Office of Water Prediction is a language- and model-agnostic framework, which allows to run a mosaic of surface and subsurface models in a single basin comprised of 10s-100s sub-catchments.
