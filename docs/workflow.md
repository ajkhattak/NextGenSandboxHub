# Run a NextGenSandbox Project

This guide assumes that the installation smoke test has passed and the project
configuration files have been reviewed. It walks through one project from
resource preparation to model execution, then introduces parallel resource
preparation and Sandbox Launcher.

## Before Starting

From the NextGenSandbox repository, load the profile used for this
installation:

```bash
source ./sandbox_profile.sh
```

Confirm that the installation is ready:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh --check
```

The `sandbox` command, ngen executable, required model libraries, t-route, and
the resource preparation environments should be available before continuing.

## Workflow Overview

Resource preparation commands are optional when suitable files already exist.
Configuration generation and model execution are separate so generated files
can be inspected before a run.

| Stage | Command | When to run it |
|---|---|---|
| Prepare hydrofabric | `sandbox --subset` | Run when gage-specific geopackages do not already exist. |
| Prepare forcing | `sandbox --forc` | Run when forcing must be downloaded, prepared, or rechunked by Sandbox. |
| Generate model files | `sandbox --conf` | Run after hydrofabric and forcing resources are available. |
| Inspect execution | `sandbox --dryrun` | Recommended after configuration generation and before a real run. |
| Execute models | `sandbox --run` | Run after generated configurations have been reviewed. |

All commands use the same project `sandbox_config.yaml`.

## Step 1: Create Project Configuration

Start from the distributed samples:

```bash
cp configs/sandbox_config.yaml configs/my_project.yaml
```

Review the following project decisions in `my_project.yaml`:

1. Choose reusable resource and generated output directories.
2. Choose one resource layout for the project.
3. Define the complete project gage set.
4. Configure the hydrofabric source or existing geopackages.
5. Configure the forcing period and source.
6. Select the formulation and any custom model instances.
7. Select the simulation task, time periods, outputs, and partitioning.
8. Add local observations only when the run uses them.

Use [configuration.md](./configuration.md) as the field reference. For
calibration or validation, also review [calibration.md](./calibration.md) and
the relevant files under `configs/calibration/`.

## Step 2: Prepare Reusable Resources

### Prepare the hydrofabric

Each selected gage needs a geopackage before configuration generation.

If gage-specific geopackages do not exist, download the source hydrofabric for
your domain. CONUS hydrofabric files are available from
[Lynker Spatial](https://www.lynker-spatial.com/data?path=hydrofabric%2Fv2.2%2F).
NextGenSandbox supports Hydrofabric 2.2. Set
`subsetting.hydrofabric.gpkg_path` and set `general.domain` to the common
domain of the selected gages. Providing the domain is especially important for
large batches because it avoids one USGS metadata request per gage. Then run:

```bash
sandbox --subset -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

Expected result:

```text
NextGenSandbox subset step completed successfully.
```

One `gage_<gage_id>.gpkg` should be present for each selected gage under the
configured resource layout.

Optionally verify that each subset basin agrees with the drainage area reported
by USGS before preparing forcing or model configurations:

```bash
bash utils/check_hydrofabric_basin_area.sh \
  --input /path/to/source/geopackages \
  --output-dir basin_area_check
```

The utility finds `*.gpkg` files recursively, extracts the gage ID from each
filename, and evaluates three independently useful areas: the sum of
`areasqkm` in the hydrofabric `divides` layer, the network-derived NLDI basin
area, and the documented NWIS `drain_area_va` value. The default classifications
are:

- `CLEAN_PASS`: hydrofabric–NLDI difference is no more than 5%, and NLDI–NWIS
  difference is no more than 10%.
- `ACCEPTABLE_OUTLET_OFFSET`: hydrofabric–NLDI difference is no more than 5%,
  and NLDI–NWIS difference is greater than 10% but no more than 20%.
- `OBSERVATION_DOMAIN_MISMATCH`: NLDI–NWIS difference exceeds 20%.
- `SUBSETTER_OR_TOPOLOGY_FAILURE`: hydrofabric–NLDI difference exceeds 5%.
- `HF_NWIS_AGREEMENT_NLDI_OUTLIER`: NLDI–NWIS exceeds 20%, but hydrofabric–
  NWIS is no more than 10%. This accepts the hydrofabric using agreement with
  the documented USGS area while retaining an explicit NLDI-outlier flag.

Change these limits with `--hf-nldi-threshold-pct`, `--clean-threshold-pct`,
`--threshold-pct`, and `--hf-nwis-fallback-threshold-pct`, respectively. The
NLDI-outlier fallback is deliberately strict: it is used only when NLDI exceeds
the maximum NLDI–NWIS tolerance, not merely when the NLDI boundary differs from
the hydrofabric. The utility returns exit status 1 when any
basin is not selected or cannot be compared, and writes the complete audit to
the requested CSV. The selected CSV uses the shared calibration-facing schema
`STAID`, `STANAME`, and `DRAIN_SQKM`. `STAID` is the gage identifier, `STANAME`
is the NWIS station name, and `DRAIN_SQKM` is the documented NWIS drainage area
converted to square kilometers. It contains all selected categories:
`CLEAN_PASS`, `ACCEPTABLE_OUTLET_OFFSET`, and
`HF_NWIS_AGREEMENT_NLDI_OUTLIER`.
Use `--passed-csv /path/to/name.csv` to choose its location or filename.
When `--cleaned-gpkg-dir` is supplied, the original GeoPackages remain
unchanged. The utility copies each one, removes divides for which at least 50%
and at least 0.1 km² lie outside the NLDI boundary. These two conditions apply
to divides that partially overlap the boundary. A divide that is effectively
100% outside is always removed, even when its total area is less than 0.1 km².
This exception is important for small external connector divides: retaining
one can leave a retained flowpath draining into a removed branch and correctly
trigger the topology safety check. The utility then removes associated
flowpath and attribute rows, checks that the deletion does not remove the
target gage or sever retained downstream connectivity, and recalculates
accumulated drainage-area attributes. Configure the two deletion limits with
`--delete-outside-fraction-pct` and `--minimum-outside-area-sqkm`. The audit
records original and corrected classifications, while `removed_divides.csv`
records every deleted divide and its outside-area measurements. Existing
cleaned files are protected unless `--overwrite-cleaned-gpkg` is supplied.
After corrected classification, accepted GeoPackages are retained in
`--cleaned-gpkg-dir` and all successfully processed but rejected GeoPackages
are moved to `--rejected-gpkg-dir`. If the rejected directory is omitted, it
defaults to `rejected_hydrofabric` beside the cleaned directory. Cleanup errors
produce no GeoPackage. The utility also writes `rejected_gages.csv`, including
the rejection status, output disposition, audit path, and cleanup error. Thus,
`cleaned_hydrofabric/*.gpkg` is intentionally safe for Sandbox forcing and
simulation workflows that discover basins with a glob. Do not glob the parent
output directory recursively because it also contains the rejected audit set.
When `--figure-dir` is supplied, the utility also retrieves the network-derived
NLDI basin boundary. `--figure-format pdf` writes one multi-page
`basin_boundary_comparisons.pdf`, ordered with failed basins first and passing
basins last. `--figure-format jpeg` writes one image per gage. The audit CSV
records the report path and page number. Omit `--figure-dir` for the faster
area-only check. Use `--figure-scope attention` to plot only failures, cleanup
errors, and basins with removed divides; use `--figure-scope all` for every
basin. NLDI boundaries downloaded for the area check are reused during cleanup
and plotting rather than downloaded again.
Accepted `HF_NWIS_AGREEMENT_NLDI_OUTLIER` basins remain in the attention report
because the fallback should be visible and reviewable even though the gage is
included in `selected_gages.csv`. When NLDI is larger than an agreeing HF/NWIS
pair, cleanup does not attempt to invent or add missing divides; the copied
hydrofabric remains unchanged.

For the recommended 5%/10%/20% thresholds and a consolidated PDF, the shell
wrapper keeps the command short:

```bash
bash utils/check_hydrofabric_basin_area.sh \
  --input '/path/to/inputs/*/hydrofabric/gage_*.gpkg' \
  --output-dir basin_area_check
```

Quote a glob so the Python utility, rather than the shell, expands it. The
output directory must be outside a directory supplied directly through
`--input`; otherwise generated GeoPackages could be rediscovered on a rerun.
The wrapper writes the audit, `selected_gages.csv`, `rejected_gages.csv`,
`removed_divides.csv`, selected-only cleaned GeoPackages, quarantined rejected
GeoPackages, and the PDF report beneath the specified output directory.
For faster batch execution, it uses eight NLDI workers and the `attention`
figure scope. Additional utility options may be appended to the wrapper command;
append `--figure-scope all` when a page for every basin is required.

To rerun cleanup after changing its rules or thresholds, overwrite the earlier
corrected copies explicitly:

```bash
bash utils/check_hydrofabric_basin_area.sh \
  --input /path/to/inputs \
  --output-dir basin_area_check \
  --overwrite-cleaned-gpkg
```

The source GeoPackages are never overwritten by this option; it replaces only
files beneath `basin_area_check/cleaned_hydrofabric`. Use `--nldi-workers 1`,
`2`, or `4` to reduce concurrent network requests when running with limited
resources. The worker count controls simultaneous web requests, not a required
number of CPU cores.

If the gage-specific geopackages already exist, use
`general.gages.option: gpkg` or place the files under the configured resource
layout. Skip `sandbox --subset`.

See [configuration.md](./configuration.md#subsetting) for settings and
[directory_layout.md](./directory_layout.md) for expected paths.

### Prepare forcing

If Sandbox should download or prepare forcing for the selected gages, run:

```bash
sandbox --forc -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

Expected result:

```text
NextGenSandbox forcing step completed successfully.
```

If forcing files already exist outside the project resource directory, set
`forcings.forcing_dir` to the file, directory, or `<gage_id>` path pattern. You
may skip this step when `rechunk: false`. With `rechunk: true`, run it once to
prepare the external files; Sandbox will not download replacements.

See [forcing.md](./forcing.md) for external forcing, multi-gage path patterns,
and NetCDF rechunking.

## Step 3: Generate Model Configuration

```bash
sandbox --conf -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

Expected result:

```text
NextGenSandbox configuration step completed successfully.
```

Generated files are written under each selected gage's output directory and
grouped by task. Calibration uses `configs/calibration`, restart uses
`configs/restart`, and control uses `configs/control`. Each named validation
uses `configs/validation` when only one validation is configured. Multiple
validations use `configs/validation/<validation_name>`. Neither layout
overwrites calibration configuration.

Every generated configuration set includes `configuration_manifest.yml`. It
records the task type, simulation window, formulation, hydrofabric, and forcing
file used during generation.

Inspect these files before execution, especially after changing a model
basefile, model instance, objective function, or simulation period.

Configuration generation does not remove existing directories by default.
Files generated at the same deterministic paths may be updated, while existing
run outputs and ngen-cal worker directories are preserved. To first remove the
active task's generated configuration directory, run:

```bash
sandbox --conf --replace-existing -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

## Step 4: Inspect the Run Command

Dry run initializes the run context and prints the ngen or ngen-cal command
without executing it:

```bash
sandbox --dryrun -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

`--dryrun` is a standalone mode. Do not combine it with `--run`, `--conf`,
`--subset`, or `--forc`.

Use the output to verify:

- selected gage and geopackage
- forcing path
- generated realization
- partition file and process count
- ngen or ngen-cal executable
- working and output directories

Before printing or executing the command, Sandbox compares the current project
settings with the configuration manifest. If the task, time window,
formulation, hydrofabric, or forcing file changed after `sandbox --conf`, it
stops and asks for configuration regeneration. For NetCDF forcing, Sandbox
also reads the file's actual time coordinate and stops when it does not cover
the requested simulation window.

## Step 5: Run the Simulation

```bash
sandbox --run -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

Expected result:

```text
NextGenSandbox run step completed successfully.
```

For calibration and validation tasks, `run_index.yml` maps the configured
period names to their timestamped ngen-cal worker directories. Optional
`simulation_metadata.yml` records the gage, formulation, task, input path,
output path, and source configuration files.

Validation uses the latest completed calibration or restart recorded in
`run_index.yml`. When no run index exists, Sandbox accepts a calibration state
only if exactly one state file and matching `best_params.txt` pair is present;
it stops on ambiguous directories rather than selecting an arbitrary state.

To start a fresh run while preserving every generated profile under `configs/`,
use:

```bash
sandbox --run --replace-existing -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

This removes prior run outputs, ngen-cal worker directories, parameter-state
files, and run indexes for each selected gage. Because `validation` and
`restart` depend on existing calibration state, run replacement is not allowed
for those task types.

When a completely fresh gage output directory is needed, regenerate
configuration with:

```bash
sandbox --conf --reset-output -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

`--reset-output` deletes the complete gage-specific output directory before
recreating it. It never deletes the project-level `general.output_dir`, and it
can only be used with `--conf`. It is not allowed for `validation` or `restart`,
which require existing calibration state.

See [directory_layout.md](./directory_layout.md) for the generated directory
structure and [calibration.md](./calibration.md) for calibration output
retention.

## Run One Gage

Use `--gage` to run one member of the configured project gage set without
editing the YAML file:

```bash
sandbox --conf --gage 01308000 -i configs/my_project.yaml
sandbox --run  --gage 01308000 -i configs/my_project.yaml
```

This is useful for diagnosing one failed gage before rerunning a larger
experiment. The supplied ID must belong to `general.gages`.

## Parallel Hydrofabric or Forcing Preparation

Subsetting and forcing preparation consist of independent serial commands per
gage. The batch helper runs several of those commands concurrently without
using Python multiprocessing inside Sandbox:

```bash
tools/batch/run_sandbox_resources_parallel.sh \
  --step forc \
  --config configs/my_project.yaml \
  --jobs 2
```

Use `--step subset` for hydrofabric preparation. The helper reads the project
gage set and the corresponding step filter directly from the YAML file.

On Slurm, `--jobs` controls concurrent gages and must not exceed
`SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK` unless `--allow-oversubscribe` is explicitly supplied.
It may be set lower than the allocated CPUs to reduce memory, filesystem I/O,
or remote-data pressure. When more gages are selected than concurrent jobs,
the remaining gages wait and run in later batches.

The helper writes per-gage logs and these summary files under its log directory:

- `selected_gages.txt`
- `success_gages.txt`
- `failed_gages.txt`

The shell script contains an editable Slurm header. It can also be run directly
from a local Linux or macOS terminal.

## When a Step Fails

Run the read-only installation check first:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh --check
```

Then see [diagnostics.md](./diagnostics.md) for environment, subsetting,
forcing, model-build, dry-run, and smoke-test issues. Failed subsetting work
also records a gage-specific error file under the configured resource root.

## Next: Scale with Sandbox Launcher

After one project configuration succeeds normally, use Sandbox Launcher to
apply configuration templates across many gages and formulations or to manage
long calibration jobs. It can also expand a reference period and per-gage
year/regime CSV into independent reference, wet, and dry calibration scenarios.

Launcher uses one self-contained YAML configuration with any user-selected
filename, such as `launcher_dds.yaml` or `launcher_pso.yaml`. It keeps normal
Sandbox blocks such as `general`, `forcings`, `observations`, `calibration`,
and `simulation` at the top level. Add `formulations` to assign model setups
to gages and `launcher` for local or Slurm scheduling. The required
`simulation.tasks` list selects calibration, validation, or both; calibration
automatically resumes incomplete work. The launcher expands this into
per-gage/per-formulation Sandbox configurations and then runs locally or
submits jobs through Slurm. In local mode, one worker continues from
calibration through validation. In Slurm mode, calibration and validation are
separate jobs managed through dependency-driven coordinator cycles.

The launcher is installed with NextGenSandbox. For Slurm, submit an arbitrary
campaign configuration with:

```bash
sandbox-launcher submit --config launcher_dds.yaml
```

Launcher and worker logs are written under
`<general.output_dir>/logs`; launcher source files remain in the
NextGenSandbox repository.

Continue to the
[Sandbox Launcher guide](launcher.md).
