# NextGenSandbox Utilities

This directory contains user-facing data utilities and optional platform setup
templates. Bootstrap implementation files live under `scripts/bootstrap/`.

## Check and Correct Hydrofabric Areas

`check_hydrofabric_basin_area.sh` is the primary user-facing shell utility. It
compares each subset GeoPackage with NLDI and documented USGS drainage areas,
removes safely identifiable divides outside the NLDI boundary, and separates
accepted and rejected GeoPackages.

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
bash utils/check_hydrofabric_basin_area.sh \
  --input /path/to/source/geopackages \
  --output-dir /path/to/basin_area_check
```

`--input` identifies the source GeoPackage, directory searched recursively, or
quoted glob. `--output-dir` identifies where every generated result will be
written and defaults to `basin_area_check` when omitted. Keep the output
directory outside a recursively scanned input directory. For a gage-organized
layout, a narrow glob avoids discovering unrelated or previously generated
GeoPackages:

```bash
--input '/path/to/inputs/*/hydrofabric/gage_*.gpkg'
```

The output directory contains:

- `basin_area_comparison.csv`: complete area and classification audit.
- `selected_gages.csv`: accepted gages using `STAID`, `STANAME`, and
  `DRAIN_SQKM` columns.
- `removed_divides.csv`: divides removed during correction.
- `rejected_gages.csv`: rejected gages and cleanup errors.
- `cleaned_hydrofabric/`: corrected, accepted GeoPackages suitable for Sandbox
  workflows.
- `rejected_hydrofabric/`: successfully processed but rejected GeoPackages.
- `figures/basin_boundary_comparisons.pdf`: attention-focused comparison
  report.

Source GeoPackages are never modified. To intentionally replace existing files
under `cleaned_hydrofabric/`, run:

```bash
bash utils/check_hydrofabric_basin_area.sh \
  --input /path/to/source/geopackages \
  --output-dir /path/to/basin_area_check \
  --overwrite-cleaned-gpkg
```

See the [hydrofabric verification section](../docs/workflow.md#prepare-the-hydrofabric)
for classifications, thresholds, and cleanup behavior. Run
`bash utils/check_hydrofabric_basin_area.sh --help` for the wrapper defaults.

## Optional Data Utilities

The scripts under `utils/python/` support optional data preparation tasks such
as downloading USGS streamflow or OpenET data and rechunking forcing files.
These are independent utilities rather than required installation steps. Run a
script with `--help` to see its inputs and options.

## Platform Setup Templates

`setup_hpc.sh` and `setup_ec2.sh` are optional platform references. For a
reusable compiler/MPI environment that can also be sourced by Sandbox Launcher
jobs, start from `configs/sandbox_profile.sh`.

Bootstrap implementation scripts and environment definitions live under
[`scripts/bootstrap/`](../scripts/bootstrap/). Use the documented
`./bootstrap.sh` options instead of invoking those internal scripts directly.
